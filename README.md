# Background

The topic of healthcare costs is one that I am interested in for two major reasons: first, I work as Data Analyst in a
healthcare organization. Second, as user of healthcare services and health insurance, I am often surprised by the
increasingly high cost of medical care in the United States. Although the quality of care is undeniable, one often wonders
if the prices charged to patients are reasonable, especially when one compares the the prices charged in other countries which also have high-quality healthcare.

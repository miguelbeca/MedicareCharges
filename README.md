# Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to both store and demonstrate the work performed as a project submission for "The Data Incubator" Fellowship program.

This page contains background information on the project, as well as, code samples and visualizations


# Background

The topic of healthcare costs is one that I am interested in for two major reasons: first, I work as Data Analyst in a
healthcare organization. Second, as user of healthcare services and health insurance, I am often surprised by the
increasingly high cost of medical care in the United States. Although the quality of care is undeniable, one often wonders
if the prices charged to patients are reasonable, especially when one compares the the prices charged in other countries which also have high-quality healthcare. As stated by The Commonwealth Fund:

> "Despite spending more on health care, Americans had poor health outcomes, including shorter life expectancy and greater prevalence of chronic conditions." 

The following chart illustrates this point:

In light of this, I sought to analyze existing public data related to healthcare costs and charges as a starting point for a possible project on this subject.
